Listen you hear This peppy song
You better pump up the volume
Turn up the volume Better pump up the volume
Here we got that Gaana swag
Mumbai town is very fair
Make you rain like super stars
Too good models at the bar
Do the bhangra like Punjabi
And our style is Sona Baabhi
Here we show you how to drink
And we show you how to party
You ain t got no Goa beach
You ain t got no Sharukh Khan
You ain t got no India gate
And we so fresh and you so late
Buy Mercedes cars Got that are rolling on my arm
So what you wanna say Saala Hip Hop Tamizhaa
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
Im a Chennai city gangster
